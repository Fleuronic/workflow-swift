/// A MenuDescription acts as a "recipe" for building and updating a specific `NSMenu`.
/// It describes how to _create_ and later _update_ a given menu instance, without creating one
/// itself. This means it is a lightweight currency you can create and pass around to describe a menu,
/// without needing to create one.
///
/// The most common use case for a `MenuDescription` is to return it from your `Screen`'s
/// `menuDescription(environment:)` method. The `WorkflowUI` machinery (or your
/// custom container menu) will then use this menu description to create or update the
/// on-screen presented menu.
///
/// As a creator of a custom container menu, you will usually pass this menu description to
/// a `DescribedMenu`, which will internally create and manage the described menu
/// for its current menu description. However, you can also directly invoke the public
/// methods such as `buildMenu()`, `update(menu:)`, if you are
/// manually managing your own menu hierarchy.

	///
	/// ### Note
	/// When creating container menus that contain other menus
	/// (eg, a navigation stack), you usually want to set this value to `false` to avoid
	/// duplicate updates to your children if they are created in `init`.
